The issue causing the test to fail in the CI is related to the expected symbol not being found as specified in the logs. The test is looking for the symbol "B<TraitA, TraitB>::Run()+4" in the output, but it is not found.

To fix the failing test and make it pass in the CI, the necessary correction should be made in the file `tests/binaries/class.cpp`. Specifically, the template class `B` should be modified to include the correct implementation of the `Run` method to match the expected symbol.

The changes to be made in the code snippet are:
1. Update the `Run` method implementation in the `B` class to include the correct output message to match the expected symbol.
2. Ensure that the `Run` method in the `B` class outputs the message "I am B\n" to match the expected symbol "B<TraitA, TraitB>::Run()+4".

After making these corrections and updating the `Run` method in the `B` class, the test should be able to find the expected symbol in the program's output, resolving the assertion error and allowing the test to pass successfully.
